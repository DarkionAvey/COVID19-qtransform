# COVID19-qtransform
A companion repository for our paper "Efficient classification of COVID-19 CT scans by using q-transform model for feature extraction"


# MATLAB code instructions
* `qTransformFeatureExtraction.m` contains the feature extraction code for healthy and COVID-19 CT scans.
* `qTransforms.m` contains the proposed function for feature extraction.
* `FinalFeaturesPeerJ.m` contains the code for adding target extracted features for classification
* The Classification is done by going to Matlab APPS > Classification Learner.
* `ALLETCT` contains the final features
* `CTFHTAB` contains the final COVID-19 features
* `CTFHTN` contains the final healthy features

The used image dataset is included in the repository
